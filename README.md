I created Rest Api using Sprng Tool Suite for Job Posting Project (Backend end logic).
Rest API:
GET: 
     http:localhost:8080/job
GET: By Id
     http:localhost:8080/job/{id}
POST:
     http:localhost:8080/job
PUT:By Id
     http:localhost:8080/job/{id}
DELETE: By Id
     http:localhost:8080/job/{id}
 
 Table name = posting
 Database name = data
 username = root
 password = root
